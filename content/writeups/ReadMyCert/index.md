This challenge gives us a .csr file, which is a certificate request. These can't be opened by default on Windows without installing OpenSSL, so I dragged the file into Kali Linux (which has OpenSSL pre-installed) on my VM to see the contents of the file.

The flag is: **picoCTF{read_mycert_693f7c03}**

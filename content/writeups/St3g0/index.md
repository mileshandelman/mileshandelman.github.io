This is a steganography challenge which gives us a .png file and instructs us to find the flag in it. During this challenge, I came across a very valuable resource for steganography challenges in [0xRick's blog](https://0xrick.github.io/lists/stego/) which lists a ton of resources for conducting stego. For this particular problem, Zsteg was the tool which saved the day; by running `zsteg -a pico.flag.png`, I was able to find the flag: `picoCTF{7h3r3_15_n0_5p00n_96ae0ac1}`
